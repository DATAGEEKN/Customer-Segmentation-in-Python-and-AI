# Customer-Segmentation-in-Python-and-AI
This project demonstrates a modern, end-to-end workflow for customer segmentation that bridges the gap between traditional machine learning and the power of Generative AI. We go beyond simply identifying clusters; we build an AI agent that interprets these segments and provides actionable marketing strategies.

This repository is a complete walkthrough of the process discussed.

The 3-Fold Challenge of Customer Segmentation
As data professionals, we know that effective customer segmentation isn't just about running an algorithm. It's a three-part challenge:

1. Identifying Segments: Finding distinct groups of customers based on their behavior and attributes.

2. Understanding Segments: Translating the numeric output of a model into meaningful, human-understandable personas.

3. Making Decisions: Devising targeted, effective marketing strategies for each segment.

Traditional machine learning excels at the first step but often leaves data scientists struggling with the other two. This project shows how to solve all three.

Project Workflow
This project is broken down into three main Python scripts that execute in sequence:

simulate_data.py: Generates a realistic, synthetic dataset of customer information, including demographics, spending habits, and engagement metrics.

perform_segmentation.py: Takes the customer data and uses the K-Means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments. It saves the segmented data and a visualization of the clusters.

customer_segmentation_agent.py: This is where the magic happens. This script loads the segmented data, sends it to an AI model (like one from OpenAI or Google), and tasks the AI with:

Analyzing the characteristics of each segment.

Assigning a descriptive, human-readable name to each segment (e.g., "High-Value Tech Enthusiasts").

Recommending specific, actionable marketing strategies for each segment.
