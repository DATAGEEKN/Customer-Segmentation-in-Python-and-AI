# Customer-Segmentation-in-Python-and-AI
This project demonstrates a modern, end-to-end workflow for customer segmentation that bridges the gap between traditional machine learning and the power of Generative AI. We go beyond simply identifying clusters; we build an AI agent that interprets these segments and provides actionable marketing strategies.

This repository is a complete walkthrough of the process discussed.

A visual representation of the project flow: Data Simulation -> ML Segmentation -> AI Agent Analysis.

The 3-Fold Challenge of Customer Segmentation
As data professionals, we know that effective customer segmentation isn't just about running an algorithm. It's a three-part challenge:

1. Identifying Segments: Finding distinct groups of customers based on their behavior and attributes.

2. Understanding Segments: Translating the numeric output of a model into meaningful, human-understandable personas.

3. Making Decisions: Devising targeted, effective marketing strategies for each segment.

Traditional machine learning excels at the first step but often leaves data scientists struggling with the other two. This project shows how to solve all three.
